# Paige Duffin first R coding exercise for BIOS8060
Please use the .html file as my submission for the assignment. I also saved a .Rmd file to the repository as a backup (and because I'm so new to this that I'm not exactly sure what would happen if I deleted it!). However, what I do know is the .html file is the final product I wish to submit. Thank you!
